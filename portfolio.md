Here are some of the projects we've worked on:

<a href="https://worldview.nasa.gov/">NASA Worldview</a> - A web-based application that provides the capability to interactively browse global satellite imagery within hours of it being acquired. Worldview supports an interactive interface for browsing full-resolution, global satellite imagery and then viewing the underlying data. Most of the 200+ available products are updated within three hours of observation, essentially showing the entire Earth as it looks "right now."

More coming soon...
