As a team, we've worked on hundreds of projects over the years. Here are a few highlights:

## [NASA Worldview](https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/)

One of our senior developers played a crucial role in enhancing NASA's Worldview application. They implemented automated browser tests, significantly reducing QA time from weeks to minutes. Our team also optimized the deployment process, cutting it down from hours to minutes, and successfully migrated an aging codebase to ES6. These improvements helped Worldview maintain its ability to provide near real-time, interactive browsing of global satellite imagery.

## [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, MapCampaigner](https://www.hotosm.org)

Our team took on the challenge of rebuilding the MapCampaigner app for the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team. One of our experienced developers led the effort to create a more efficient and user-friendly application for managing and monitoring field data collection campaigns in OpenStreetMap, enhancing the organization's ability to coordinate humanitarian mapping efforts worldwide.

## [Climate Central, Picturing Our Future](https://picturing.climatecentral.org/)

Our team was instrumental in bringing Climate Central's vision to life. One of our senior engineers spearheaded the development of a Next.js app for visualizing sea level rise predictions globally. This project, known as "Picturing Our Future," allows users to view detailed sea level rise simulations around the world, making complex climate data accessible and visually impactful.

## [SpaceTango ISS Dashboard](https://www.spacetango.com)

In a collaboration with Sparkart Group, our team developed a custom dashboard for SpaceTango's International Space Station (ISS) payloads. Our senior developer led the project, creating a React app that provides real-time data visualization and monitoring for SpaceTango's experiments aboard the ISS. This dashboard enables SpaceTango to track and analyze experiment data in near real-time, helping to optimize their research and development processes.
